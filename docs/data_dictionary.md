```
Attrition Rate = (Employees Who Left / Total Employees) × 100
Current Rate: 16.1%
```

### High Risk Employee
An employee with RiskScore ≥ 70, indicating:
- 70%+ probability of leaving within 12 months
- Requires immediate retention intervention

### Replacement Cost
```
Replacement Cost = 1.5 × Annual Salary

SELECT 
    EmployeeNumber,
    Department,

    MonthlyIncome,
    RiskScore
FROM employees
WHERE RiskLevel = 'HIGH'
ORDER BY RiskScore DESC;
```

### Department Attrition Rates
```sql
SELECT 
    Department,
    COUNT(*) as Total,
    SUM(Attrition) as Left,
    ROUND(AVG(Attrition) * 100, 1) as AttritionRate
FROM employees
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY AttritionRate DESC;
```

### Salary vs Risk Correlation
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN MonthlyIncome < 3000 THEN 'Low'
